Content for the talk about JS and webcam in browsers.

## Title

Playful webcam

## Description

Take photos, record or stream video and audio: all these
we can now be done with native browser capabilities and JS.

But, can we configure our camera the way we do it on smartphones?
Zoom, maybe? Apply a mask like in Stories?
Change the voice?
Or, transform a video stream into ASCII?

I'll tell you how to work with the webcam in browsers:
starting from scratch and apply the crazy stuff in the end.

### My bio

I'm frontend developer at [Uploadcare][uploadcare],
I work on a widget for uploading files
used by thousands of companies around the globe.

I live in Saint-Petersburg, Russia, where I'm also a founder and
co-organizer of the [SPB Frontend][spb-frontend] community.

My path in web dev started back in a day
when JS was only used to make it snow on pages.
I like how web technologies and JS have evolved since.
