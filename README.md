Content of talk about JS and webcam in browser

## Title

Playful webcam

## Description

Take photos, record or stream video and audio - all of these
we can be done now with native browser capabilities and JS.

But can we configure the camera like on smartphones? Zoom it?
Can we recognize faces and apply the mask, as in the stories?
Or change the voice and make it like that of Darth Vader?
Maybe transform a video stream into a ASCII representation?

I'll tell you how to work with the webcam in the browser
from the beginning and to applying some crazy stuff.
