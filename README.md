Content for the talk on JS and webcam in browsers

## Title

Playful webcam

## Description
Taking photos, recording or streaming video and audio: all these
can now be done with native browser capabilities and JS.

But, can we configure our camera the way we do it on smartphones?
Zoom, maybe? Applying a mask like in Stories? Changing the voice?
Or, how about transforming a video stream into ASCII?

I'll tell you how to handle webcam in browsers:
starting from scratch and applying some crazy stuff in the end.

### My bio

I'm a Frontend Developer with [Uploadcare][uploadcare]
and I work on a widget for uploading files
used by thousands of companies around the globe.

I live in Saint-Petersburg, Russia, where I'm also a founder and
active partaker of the [SPB Frontend][spb-frontend] community.

My path in webdev started back in a day when JS was only
used to make it snowing on pages. I like how web technologies and JS
in particular have evolved since.

Also, I like cats and series by Netflix and Sy-fy.

block for handling files we provide grants our users simple controls over complex
technologies. With Uploadcare, you get an uploading interface, storage, processing,
caching, and delivery in a few lines of code.
